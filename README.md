# computerVision-1
This project implements real-time color detection using OpenCV and a webcam. It detects specified colors in a video stream, highlights them with bounding boxes, and displays their names on the screen.

Features
✅ Detects predefined colors (Blue, Yellow, Green) in real time.
✅ Uses HSV color space for robust color detection.
✅ Applies adaptive thresholding and morphological operations to reduce noise.
✅ Mirrors the video feed horizontally for a natural user experience.
✅ Enhances brightness to improve detection accuracy.
✅ Displays real-time bounding boxes and labels around detected colors.
